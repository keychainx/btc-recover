# *seedrecover.py* #

*seedrecover.py* is a Bitcoin seed recovery tool which can take a seed with one or more mistakes in it, and recover the correct seed if not too many mistakes have been made.


## Installation ##

Just download the latest version from <https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover/archive/master.zip> and unzip it to a location of your choice.

Additional requirements are described below.

### Windows ###

 1. Follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md#python-27) to download and install Python 2.7.

 2. Visit this page to download Armory for Windows: <https://bitcoinarmory.com/download/>. If you installed the 64-bit version of Python, download and install the latest version of Armory. If you installed the 32-bit version of Python, download and install a **0.92.x** version of Armory.

    (*seedrecover.py* uses Armory's included Crypto++ library to accelerate the Eliptic Curve math it needs to perform; you do not need to start Armory for any reason.)


### Linux and OS X ###

Download and install the latest version of Armory from here: <https://bitcoinarmory.com/download/>. Because Armory has a number of dependencies, installing it on Linux or OS X isn't always easy. For Debian-like distributions, a shell script has been provided (in the same directory as this README file) which will automatically download Armory, verify its signature, and then install it along with all of the required dependencies. Simply run it from a terminal window:

    sudo ./install-armory.sh

## Running *seedrecover.py* ##

In order to run *seedrecover.py*, you'll need two things:

 1. A good estimate of what your seed is.

 2. *One* of the following, in order of preference:
     1. for Electrum (1.x or 2.x), a copy of your wallet file,
     2. your master public key,
     3. or a receiving address that was generated by your wallet from your seed, along with a good estimate of how many addresses you created before the receiving address you'd like to use.

Actually running *seedrecover.py* is simple: just double-click it. If you're given an option between running it in a terminal or without one, choose *Run in Terminal*. Then, just answer the on-screen questions.
